Unswitch is a tiny event handler for Switch controllers on the web based on the Gamepad API. Attach callbacks to button presses (up & down) and the joystick!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save unswitch
```

> Use script tags or modules? Check out the version on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/unswitch)!

## Setup
Connecting a Switch controller is easy: pair it with bluetooth and you're ready to go! This library doesn't listen to `connected` or `disconnected` events but in some cases it might be useful. Here's how you can listen to these events:

```js
window.addEventListener("gamepadconnected", ({ gamepad }) => {});
```

```js
window.addEventListener("gamepaddisconnected", ({ gamepad }) => {});
```

## Usage

```js
// Import the library
import Unswitch from 'unswitch';

// Observe a controller
const unswitch = new Unswitch({
  side: 'L', // or R
  buttons: (button, pressed, side) => console.log(`Catch-all - button: ${button} was ${pressed ? 'pressed' : 'released'} on the ${side} side`),
  b: p => {},
  a: p => {},
  y: p => {},
  x: p => {},
  sl: p => {},
  sr: p => {},
  minus: p => {},
  plus: p => {},
  lstick: p => {},
  rstick: p => {},
  home: p => {},
  screenshot: p => {},
  bumper: p => {}, // L or R
  trigger: p => {}, // ZL or ZR
  axes: p => {},
});

function render() {
  // Call the update function manually
  unswitch.update();
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

render();
```

Please note that it's not required to pass all button-functions to Unswitch and will only be executed when you provide them.
You are able to use the `buttons` function to catch all button presses and implement your own logic using the provided data. The `buttons` function will always be executed when provided, even when the button is also passed as property.

It's possible to connect up to two controllers at the same time. To make this work `side` is to be passed with either `L` (left) or `R` (right) for the controllers respectively. Calling `unswitch.update()` will check every button for a change in state. If a callback is provided the new state is passed along. The axis works in the same way, but instead of a `boolean` it will return a `number` from 0 to 8. Number 0 to 7 are for the joystick positions going clockwise, number 8 is used as default (center).

> Buttons are mapped based on a single controller positioned horizontally.
